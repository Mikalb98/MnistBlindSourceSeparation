# MnistBlindSourceSeparation

This mini-project consists of a Google Colab Notebook that was implemented for a university examination. Specifically, I was asked to develop a neural network capable of separating overlapping images in the two original images (Blind Source Analysis).

***Please Note:***<br>
The notebook has also text cells where I explained precisely all of the steps in the code.
